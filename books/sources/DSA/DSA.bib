@electronic{Robert-Google,
	Abstract = {Abstract---In this experience report we encode a well specified,
compact benchmark in four programming languages, namely
C++, Java, Go, and Scala. The implementations each use the
languages' idiomatic container classes, looping constructs, and
memory/object allocation schemes. It does not attempt to exploit
specific language and run-time features to achieve maximum
performance. This approach allows an almost fair comparison
of language features, code complexity, compilers and compile
time, binary sizes, run-times, and memory footprint.
While the benchmark itself is simple and compact, it employs many language features, in particular, higher-level data
structures (lists, maps, lists and arrays of sets and lists), a few
algorithms (union/find, dfs / deep recursion, and loop recognition
based on Tarjan), iterations over collection types, some object
oriented features, and interesting memory allocation patterns.
We do not explore any aspects of multi-threading, or higher level
type mechanisms, which vary greatly between the languages.
The benchmark points to very large differences in all examined
dimensions of the language implementations. After publication of
the benchmark internally at Google, several engineers produced
highly optimized versions of the benchmark. We describe many
of the performed optimizations, which were mostly targeting runtime performance and code complexity. While this effort is an
anecdotal comparison only, the benchmark, and the subsequent
tuning efforts, are indicative of typical performance pain points
in the respective languages.},
